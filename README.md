# CS-255

These two projects were created for CS 255 Systems Analysis and Design. 

The DriverPass project was one in which the fictitious company DriverPass came to our software development company with a request to design and then implement a system by which
customers can access the website, create a profile, take online practice tests or lessons, and schedule real life driving instructions. The goal of the company was to improve
the scores of budding drivers who were not passing their DMV driving tests on their first attempt. 

For this, I created a business requirements document and a system design document. The business requirements emphasizes the what and how of the approach to this task, and uses
a transcript as a guideline. The system design document is the example layout and choices that were made in designing this system with the interests and preferences of DriverPass
always kept in mind.

If I had to revise one portion, I feel as though business requirements is something I need more practice and real world experience with to get a better picture of what is
"too much" and what is "not enough". I understand generally what is required of a certain document like this, but struggle with consistency between professors.

The user's needs were based off my own experiences and readings. I imagined myself as an average user, and determined what aspects of a system would make the experience the most
efficient. It's always important to make sure a system is both intuitive, and serves its function.
